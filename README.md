# Gregers's dotfiles

Here are my dotfiles that I mainly use to develop with Zephyr for Nordic Semiconductor.
I put them here for backup and in case someone else find them useful.

> [!WARNING]
> I'm using macOS and ZSH with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install), but I've attempted to make the configurations compatible with bash and linux.

## Installation

Setup is manual. Just copy or symlink the files into `$HOME`.

## Thanks to

- [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/) for most of the [dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) repo structure.
